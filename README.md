On 64bit systems, raw pointers require an amount of 8 bytes (or 64 bits). This allows us to use more than 4GB RAM, however most applications actually require much less than this amount of RAM. In such cases, to avoid unnecessary waste of memory, pointers should store only 4 bytes (or 32 bits), thus further reducing the amount of RAM used.

The purpose of this project is to provide solutions for compressing 64bit pointers intro 32bit integers. An option is to implement a method similar to the one used by the JVM, described at https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/CompressedOops . Basicallly, since on 64bit systems, at least the 3 lower tag bits are always zero, we can choose to ignore these bits, and use them instead to simulate 35bit addresses, allowing us to use 32GB of RAM with 32bit integers. This works ok, as long as the total amount of memory (inlucding both RAM and virtual memory) available is less than this amount.

A safer solution on 64bit systems having more than 32GB RAM, would be to use a dynamic array of 64bit pointers, and store the 32bit index of this array. In this case, we have to sacrifice 1 bit from the 32bit integer, to specify wether we're storing an address smaller than 16GB, or alternatively we're storing the index to the dynamic array. Even when a pointer is stored this array, the advantage is it will theoretically require 8 bytes only once. Nonetheless, this solution is not ideal, especially when access to the array needs to be thread-safe.
